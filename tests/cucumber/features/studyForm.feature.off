Feature: A form for setting up a ranavirus study
  As a user
  I want to set up a ranavirus study
  So I can add reports individually

  Scenario: Submitting a non-pdf publication
    Given I have logged in
    And I am on the "study" page
    When I fill out the form
    And I upload a non-pdf publication
    And I click submit
    Then the webpage should display a validation error

  Scenario: Submitting a publication without a reference
    Given I have logged in
    And I am on the "study" page
    When I fill out the form
    And I upload a pdf publication
    But I do not provide text for the reference field
    And I click submit
    Then the webpage should display a validation error
    When I fill out the publicationInfo.reference field with "the journal Nature"
    And I click submit
    Then the webpage should not display a validation error
    And I should see a "insert successful" toast
