      # Importing Data

      Rather than individually adding records to a study one at a time through the web interface, you may wish to perform a bulk upload of records when you create a new study. To do so, you must transform your data to match the import format expected by the system.

      When filling out the [New Study form](/study), any report fields you choose to fill out will become default values for all reports associated with that study. These will be pre-filled on the form for new reports, and they will also be default values for reports added via imports. If no data is specified for a field in the import file, any value specified for the entire study will be used. If a value is specified in the import however, it will override any defaults set on the study.

      Below is a description of each field and the values it may take. Unless otherwise specified, values may be arbitrary strings. The variable names correspond to column names in the header row of a spreadsheet. Data must be exported in the comma-separated value (CSV) format prior to being imported into the system.

      Here is an example CSV file with every field specified. In your own file, do not include any columns for which you have no data.

      [Sample CSV import file](/sample_csv_import.csv)

      ## Contact
      ```
      contact.name
      contact.email
      contact.phone
      contact.institutionAddress.name
      contact.institutionAddress.street
      contact.institutionAddress.street2
      contact.institutionAddress.city
      contact.institutionAddress.stateOrProvince
      contact.institutionAddress.country
      contact.institutionAddress.postalCode
      ```

      These fields specify the contact information for the person responsible for this report. If they are not specified in the CSV file, they will be inherited from the study.


      ## Event Date and Location

      ### Date

      ```eventDate```

      The date the event occurred. Use `MM/DD/YYYY` format.

      ### Location

      Location coordinates can be specified in one of three ways. No matter what input format is used, the location is converted into decimal degrees latitude and longitude to use for map display, but the original input format is recorded and preserved. The `eventLocation.country` field, containing the name of the country where the event occurred, must be specified as well if coordinates are given. To include location data in a report, specify each field in one of the following sets of fields:

      ##### Latitude and Longitude in Decimal Degrees
      ```
      eventLocation.latitude
      eventLocation.longitude
      ```

      ##### Latitude and Longitude in Degrees / Minutes / Seconds
      ```
      eventLocation.degreesLon
      eventLocation.minutesLon
      eventLocation.secondsLon
      eventLocation.degreesLat
      eventLocation.minutesLat
      eventLocation.secondsLat
      ```

      ##### UTM
      ```
      eventLocation.northing
      eventLocation.easting
      eventLocation.zone
      ```


      #### Country

      ```eventLocation.country```

      In addition to location coordinates, if you specify a location you must include the location's country name.

      ## Animal Characteristics

      ### Species information
      ```
      speciesGenus
      speciesName
      speciesNotes
      ```

      Fully specified SpeciesName should also include the genus.

      ### Number of Animals Involved
      ```numInvolved```

      Allowed values:
      `1, 2_10, 11_50, 51_100, 101_500, 500_`

      The number of animals involved falls into one of six buckets, from one animal to more than 500 animals.

      ### Animal testing
      ```
      totalAnimalsTested
      totalAnimalsConfirmedInfected
      totalAnimalsConfirmedDiseased
      ```

      Integer values for the total number of animals tested, confirmed infected, and confirmed diseased.

      ### Population type
      ```populationType```

      Allowed values:
      `wild, zoological, production`

      ### Vertebrate Classes
      ```vertebrateClasses```

      Allowed values:
      `fish, amphibian, reptile`

      ### Age Classes
      ```ageClasses```

      Allowed values:
      `egg, larvae, juvenile, adult`


      ## Methods

      ### Ranavirus Confirmation Methods
      ```
      ranavirusConfirmationMethods
      specifyOtherRanavirusConfirmationMethods
      ```

      You may supply multiple methods in a comma-separated list. Allowed values:
      `traditional_pcr, qrt_pcr, virus_isolation, sequencing, electron_microscopy, in_situ_hybridization, immunohistochemistry, other`

      If other confirmation methods are specified, include the value `other` in the list and then include the values for each
      other confirmation method in a comma-separated list in the `specifyOtherRanavirusConfirmationMethods` field.

      ### Sample Type
      ```
      sampleType
      specifyOtherRanavirusSampleTypes
      ```

      You may supply multiple sample types in a comma-separated list. Allowed values:
      `internal_swabs, external_swabs, internal_organ_tissues, tail_toe_clips, blood, other`

      If other confirmation sample types are specified, include the value `other` in the list and then include the values for each
      other sample type in a comma-separated list in the `specifyOtherRanavirusSampleTypes` field.
      ```

      ## Gen Bank Accession Numbers
      ```genBankAccessionNumbers```

      Use a comma-separated list to include multiple values.

      ## Additional Notes
      ```additionalNotes```

      Specify any additional notes for the report.

      ## Consent
      ```consent```

      Use the value `1` or `true` if you consent to sharing this report, `0` or `false` if not.

      ## Data Use Permissions
      ```dataUsePermissions```

      Choose only one of the following values:
      `Do not share, Share obfuscated, Share full record`
